# Notes

## Setup and first time installation

There's a number of things that can go wrong setting up the environment for react native project. You will find a lot of information online, I've just added here some of the issues I've found building this project on Mac OS X and Linux.

### Initial creation of the app

```sh
npx react-native init dognews_checker
```

### Weird gradle errors

For some Oracle-y reason, gradle will throw bizarre errors if not using the Java SDK 1.8.

```sh
jenv local 1.8
```

On a mac: `brew cask install adoptopenjdk8`

### Missing keystore for android builds

Android needs to have a debug keystore. You can create one as follows:

```sh
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ./android/app/debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

^ the password above is 'android', we don't care too much about it as it's just the debug keystore

### Missing emulator engine

If facing the following error:

> PANIC: Missing emulator engine program for 'x86' CPU.

Solve by adding something like this to your .bashrc/profile:

```sh
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$PATH"
```

The order there is important, emulator before tools.

### eslint in Visual Studio Code complains

> ESLint: ESLint configuration in .eslintrc.js Â» @react-native-community/eslint-config is invalid: - Property "overrides" is the wrong type (expected array but got `{"files":["**/__tests__/**/*.js","**/*.spec.js","**/*.test.js"],"env":{"jest":true,"jest/globals":true}}`).  Referenced from: .../dognews_checker_react/.eslintrc.js. Please see the 'ESLint' output channel for details.

Solved by

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-eslint eslint eslint-plugin-react
```

`vim .eslintrc`:

```json
{
    "parser": "babel-eslint",
    "env": {
        "browser": true
    },
    "plugins": [
        "react"
    ],
    "extends": [
        "eslint:recommended",
        "plugin:react/recommended"
    ],
    "rules": {
        // overrides
    }
}
```

Also remove the auto generated .eslintrc.js (that had `module.exports = { root: true, extends: '@react-native-community', };`)

### Debugging on the emulator

The protocol listens on [http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui](http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui)

On VS Code, Add Configuration, React Native Android, generates:

```json
{
    "name": "React Native Android",
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "type": "reactnative",
    "request": "launch",
    "platform": "android"
},
```

This launches the app and starts listening, but breakpoints don't work yet.

To launch the debug menu in the emulator we press

> COMMAND+M   a couple of times means shake

and then from there select 'Debug JS Remotely'

## React notes

### Native Library links (react-native link)

React native libraries that contain native code need that made known to react the final native project.

Although in theory this is [all done automagically via Autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md)
I've run into problems with this and the only solution seems to manually link. The following sections
detail how.

### Navigation

As per [the official guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation):

```sh
npm install --save react-navigation
+ react-navigation@3.11.1
added 19 packages from 8 contributors and audited 948879 packages in 5.991s

npm install --save react-native-gesture-handler
+ react-native-gesture-handler@1.3.0
added 2 packages from 2 contributors and audited 948889 packages in 4.188s

npx react-native link react-native-gesture-handler
```

### WebViews

```sh
npm install --save react-native-webview
npx react-native link react-native-webview
```

Otherwise it throws:

```text

...
```

## Prettify with prettier

I've added [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to the project and gave it control of what the code needs to look like.

```sh
npx i --save-dev prettier
```

To reformat the code, simply run:

```sh
npx run pretty
```

> Note that this will simply run the script defined in package.json, which is something like `npx prettier --write '{app,lib,__tests__,__mocks__}/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'`

Prettier can be tweaked in the [prettier.config.js](./prettier.config.js) file.

## Migrating Authentication / Authorization to Okta

The best resource for this is [Matt Raible's React Native Login entry at okta](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/11/14/react-native-login)

After trying the default django authentication I'm moving to using [okta](https://www.okta.com/) for identity. You can register as a developer with a maximum of 1000 unique users per month which seems more than enough for this little app.

npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/schematics-cli  # code generator from the Angular project
npm i --save-dev @oktadev/schematics
npx schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth

> Asks: What is your OIDC app's issuer URL? This is found in  API > Authorization Server, I pick the default one [https://dev-142820.okta.com/oauth2/default](https://dev-142820.okta.com/oauth2/default)
> Asks: What is your OIDC app's client ID? This is found in Applications

After this it starts generating pages:

CREATE /Auth.js (4345 bytes)
  A component that emits: 'signInSuccess', 'signOutSuccess', 'onError', 'onCancelled'
  A checkAuthentication method that changes state depending on auth state
  Functions: login(), logout(), getUserIdToken(), getMyUser()
  Renders a login button or, if authenticated, a logout button with two buttons to get User from Id and get User

CREATE /auth.config.js (342 bytes)
  The data entered as part of the setup, via schematics. This is all public data as it's embedded in the app (client id, redirect url, ...)

CREATE /setupJest.js (812 bytes)
  Mocks okta SDK. I move this into `__setup__` as okta.js

CREATE /tests/App-test.js (357 bytes)
  A simple 'renders' test. It differs from the typical one in mocking an extra class:
> jest.mock('../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/EventEmitter/NativeEventEmitter');
  I delete this file

CREATE /tests/Auth-test.js (5233 bytes)
  Set of tests for the login components in authenticated and unautenthicated state
  Moved to `__tests__`

UPDATE /package.json (2041 bytes)
  Added "@okta/okta-react-native" to deps and
  added @angular-devkit/schematics-cli, @oktadev/schematics, enzyme, enzyme-adapter-react-16, enzyme-async-helpers, react_dom,
  and a whole jest section with:

```json
  "jest": {
        "preset": "react-native",
        "automock": false,
        "transformIgnorePatterns": [
            "node_modules/(?!@okta|react-native)"
        ],
        "testMatch": [
            "**/tests/*.js?(x)",
            "**/?(*.)(spec|test).js?(x)"
        ],
        "setupFiles": [
            "./setupJest.js"
        ]
    }
```

  I remove the jest section and copy into jest.config.js.

UPDATE /ios/Podfile (2311 bytes)
  Increases ios platform to 11

UPDATE /android/build.gradle (993 bytes)
  Increses min sdk to 19

UPDATE /android/app/build.gradle (8345 bytes)
  Adds a line to declare the redirect on defaultConfig

Need to ajust this, as by default it had a dev-xxxx url:

```diff
+        manifestPlaceholders = [ appAuthRedirectScheme: "com.onlydognews.dognewsreviewapp" ]
```

> Error if not changed is: E SyncWebAuthClientImpl: No uri registered to handle redirect or multiple applications registered

UPDATE /App.js (3152 bytes)
  It wipes our App.js and replaces it with a demo login page. I roll back.
  The only thing it does is `import ./Auth` and add `<Auth />` in the page.

> ^ the above is in commit e5ae41d41a45913abf755196830b73dd5ed10313

## Migrating to use a generic oauth2 integration

After adding the previous code, there are numerous links to Okta which could make moving to another oauth provider hard.
For a solution that uses okta as an oauth2 provider we'll follow [Formidable Lab's guide on the react-native-app-auth repo](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-app-auth)
First we undo all that was done in the previous section: removal of all @okta packages etc.

* Install the auth library

```bash
npm i --save react-native-app-auth
react-native link
```

* Register the native part of the library for iOS

Add this to `Podfile`

```txt
pod 'AppAuth', '>= 0.94'
```

* Register the redirect URL scheme

This is needed since iOS 10. We need to add a mapping for the schema of our app to Info.plist in iOS:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
<dict>
  <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
  <string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
  <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
  <array>
    <string>com.onlydognews.dognewsreviewapp</string>
  </array>
</dict>
</array>
```

* Define openURL callback in AppDelegate

Register the OpenID authorization flow in `AppDelegate.h` (added the RNAppAuthAuthorizationFlowManager paramater to the AppDelegate @protocol entry and the authorizationFlowManagerDelegate @property):

```objectivec
#import <React/RCTBridgeDelegate.h>
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import "RNAppAuthAuthorizationFlowManager.h"
@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate, RCTBridgeDelegate, RNAppAuthAuthorizationFlowManager>
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIWindow *window;
// oauth2
@property(nonatomic, weak)id<RNAppAuthAuthorizationFlowManagerDelegate>authorizationFlowManagerDelegate;
@end
```

The callback comes via openURL app delegate, so we register our delegate that will listen for it:

```objectivec
...
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *)options {
 return [self.authorizationFlowManagerDelegate resumeExternalUserAgentFlowWithURL:url];
}

@end
```

* Error on building android
